It is easy to set up rscripts to run automatically. This is easily done with three processes.
1. Set up Windows to run a bat-script automatically.
2. Let the bat-script call R. We call two R-scripts, one that sources all R-scripts to do the job and one that check the log and report the results.

## Set up Windows to run a bat-script automatically
We use Windows rutine for this. See help here to set up a batch jop. Contact epi to get access to a server to host the script.
